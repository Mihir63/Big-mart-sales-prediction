Big-mart-sales-prediction
This project aims to predict the Item Outlet Sales for products sold at different Big Mart stores using a variety of features related to the product and the store. The dataset contains both product-level and outlet-level information.
Predict the sales of products at various retail outlets using machine learning models.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project aims to predict the Item Outlet Sales for products sold at different Big Mart stores using a variety of features related to the product and the store. The dataset contains both product-level and outlet-level information.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset includes two files:

Train_UWu5bXk.csv: Contains training data with target column Item_Outlet_Sales.

Test_u94Q5KV.csv: Test data without the target, for which predictions are to be made.

ðŸ”‘ Features

Column	Description
Item_Identifier	Unique product ID
Item_Weight	Weight of the product
Item_Fat_Content	Product's fat content (Low Fat / Regular)
Item_Visibility	Display area of the product in store
Item_Type	Category of the product
Item_MRP	Maximum Retail Price
Outlet_Identifier	Unique store ID
Outlet_Establishment_Year	Year of establishment
Outlet_Size	Store size (Small/Medium/High)
Outlet_Location_Type	Store's city tier
Outlet_Type	Type of store (Grocery/Supermarket)
Item_Outlet_Sales	Target variable (only in training data)
ðŸ§¹ Data Preprocessing
Merged train and test datasets for uniform preprocessing.

Cleaned inconsistent labels in Item_Fat_Content.

Imputed missing values:

Item_Weight: mean imputation.

Outlet_Size: mode imputation.

Dropped unique identifiers: Item_Identifier, Outlet_Identifier.

Encoded categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding.

Split dataset into train-validation sets (80-20).

ðŸ§  Models Used
Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

XGBoost Regressor

Each model is wrapped in a pipeline with preprocessing steps using scikit-learn.

ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metric
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) on validation set.
